# Exercises Directory

The Exercises directory is dedicated to a series of coding challenges and exercises designed to reinforce Python programming skills. Each exercise focuses on different concepts and encourages problem-solving and critical thinking. Learners are encouraged to attempt these exercises independently, and solutions are provided for reference. This directory aims to foster a deeper understanding of Python through practice and experimentation.
